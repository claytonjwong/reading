# Speed Reading with the Right Brain
## Learn to read ideas instead of just words
* **Conceptual reading:** imagining / visualing what you are reading 
	* see what it feels like to fly through words with excellent comprehension

## Reading Strategies:
* **left brain:**
	* serial processing ( one-step at a time )
	* bad habit of subvocalization ( pronouncing words, as if speaking them to myself while reading )
		* ex: rapid serial visual presentation, helps to see words faster and reduce subvocalization
	* most folks plateau at around 400 words per minute ( wpm ) with this strategy
		* the rate of physical eye movement is the limiting factor
		* seeing words faster is *not* reading faster

* **right brain:** parallel processing of asbstract thoughts and ideas
	* read chunks / phrases at a time as conceptualized ideas
	* looks for patterns of information simultaneously
		* ex: looking at an entire chunk of data and understanding the idea or concept being expressed

The result is that the two sides have different personalities and see the world in different ways.  But it is
the partnership of this odd couple which allows us to make careful analyses and leaps of intuition.

## What is speed reading?
* Text-to-Idea transformation
	* knowledge transfer objectively measured by rate of comprehension
	* reading faster is equivalent to comprending faster
		* instead of reading words, focus on seeing ideas

Real reading is something that occurs AFTER you recognize the words.  It is what happens
when you realize what the writer is saying / thinking when writing the words.  You haven't
read anything until you've comprehended it.

There is no clock in your mind.  Reading speed is very flexible and relative to your thinking speed.
If you can comprehend faster, you will be thinking faster, but what you read will always seem to be
taking place at "normal" speed in your mind.

## Strategy
* Focus on *comprehending* faster and *reading* faster will naturally follow
* Forget about how *fast* you are reading and focus on *what* you are reading
* View reading as comprehension

## Goals
* read whole phrases at a time as if they were single words
	* phrase highlighting helps to practice
	* acquire proper mindset for reading phrases by understanding how / why phrase highlighting works
* develop a personal heuristic for a dynamic phrase highlighting algorithm
	* practice on un-highlighted text ( non-deterministic process, there is no right or wrong )
	* focus attention on meanings of phrases being read by comprehending larger chuks of information at a time

## Practice
* reading text in larger chunks transfers greater amounts of information per glance
	* easier and faster to concentrate on the meaningful concepts
	* emphasizes the true limiting factor, comprehension
		* prioritize comprehension first
		* speed reading occurs as a natural side-effect of speed comprehending
* specially formatted text at the end of each chapter
	* First 1,000 words from various sources
	* Reading speed = 60,000 / # seconds to read the first 1,000 words = words per minute ( wpm )
		* objective measurement of reading speed

* Children's books
	* I love reading to my children!  Here's how I've been learning to speed read on my own:
		1. look at the middle of the text on the page
		2. coalesce all words in parallel as a whole phrase transformed into a single, concise thought
		3. "see" the meaning of that concise thought in my mind's eye through visualization / conceptualization
			* note: this is an internal subconcious automatic function of my right brain
		4. look at the picture in the book 
		5. repeat above steps as needed until full comprehension is acquired
		6. verbalize the meaning to my kids
	* small, concise chunks of meaningful data at a time
	* perfect for visualizating words as phrases and transforming those phrases into thoughts / meanings / ideas / images
	* there's literally a picture of the text's meaning in the book ( visualization of the meaning is simply a glance away )
		* the glance location is irrelevant as meaning of the text and the picture of the text are the same
			* i.e. looking at text and visualizing its meaning is the same exact concept as looking at the picture and visualizing its meaning
			
## Speed Reading is Speed Comprehending
* acquire clearer / faster comprehension
	* conceptualize phrases of words by imagining what the group of words mean
		* transfer data to the right side of your brain for parallel processing
		* imagine whole, complex ideas at once, as a single cohensive thought
	* distinct pieces of information are whole units of meaning ( ideas which can be visualized / conceptualized )
		* actively seek conceptual units of information
			* *not* smooth, consistent flows of evenly distributed data
			* more like clumps of ideas, look for the clumps, that will help you see them
		* proactive searching frame of mind causes clumps to automatically appear for you
