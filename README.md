# Speed Reading with the Right Brain
## Learn to read ideas instead of just words
![](speed_reading.png)
* **Conceptual reading:** imagining / visualing what you are reading 

## Reading Strategies:
* **left brain:**
	* serial processing, one-step at a time
	* subvocalization
		* pronouncing words while reading is the limiting factor / bottleneck
		* maximum ~200 words per minute ( wpm )
	* rapid serial visual presentation
		* helps to see words faster by *not* allowing time for subvocalization of individual words
		* seeing words faster is *not* reading faster
		* the rate of physical eye movement is the limiting factor
		* maximum ~500 words per minute ( wpm )

* **right brain:** parallel processing of asbstract thoughts and ideas
	* read chunks / phrases at a time as conceptualized ideas
	* look for patterns of information simultaneously
	* hollistic understanding of entire chunks of data as ideas or concepts

The left brain and right brain have different personalities and see the world in different ways.  But it is
the partnership of this odd couple which allows us to make careful analyses and leaps of intuition.

## What is speed reading?
* Text-to-Idea transformation
	* knowledge transfer objectively measured by rate of comprehension
	* reading faster is equivalent to comprending faster
		* instead of reading words, focus on seeing ideas

Real reading is something that occurs AFTER you recognize the words.  It is what happens
when you realize what the writer is saying / thinking when writing the words.  You haven't
read anything until you've comprehended it.

There is no clock in your mind.  Reading speed is very flexible and relative to your thinking speed.
If you can comprehend faster, you will be thinking faster, but what you read will always seem to be
taking place at "normal" speed in your mind.

## Strategy
* Focus on *comprehending* faster and *reading* faster will naturally follow
* Forget about how *fast* you are reading and focus on *what* you are reading
* Reading is comprehension and comprehension is conceptualization

## Goals
* read whole phrases at a time as if they were single words
	* phrase highlighting helps to practice
	* acquire proper mindset for reading phrases by understanding how / why phrase highlighting works
* develop a personal heuristic for a dynamic phrase highlighting algorithm
	* practice on un-highlighted text ( non-deterministic process, there is no right or wrong )
	* focus attention on meanings of phrases being read by comprehending larger chuks of information at a time
	* extract keywords which tie the overall structure of sentences / paragraphs together
		* common keywords are nouns and verbs
		* usally the *first* word of a sentence and *last* word of each phrase

## Practice
* reading text in larger chunks transfers greater amounts of information per glance
	* easier and faster to concentrate on the meaningful concepts
	* emphasizes the true limiting factor, comprehension
		* prioritize comprehension first
		* speed reading occurs as a natural side-effect of speed comprehending
* specially formatted text at the end of each chapter
	* First 1,000 words from various sources
	* Reading speed = 60,000 / # seconds to read the first 1,000 words = words per minute ( wpm )
		* objective measurement of reading speed
* Online phrase reading tool
	* [http://phrasereader.com/](http://phrasereader.com/)
* Children's books
	* I love reading to my children!  Here's how I've been learning to speed read on my own:
		1. look at the middle of the text on the page
		2. coalesce all words in parallel as a whole phrase transformed into a single, concise thought
		3. "see" the meaning of that concise thought in my mind's eye through visualization / conceptualization
			* note: this is an internal subconscious automatic function of my right brain
		4. look at the picture in the book 
		5. repeat above steps as needed until full comprehension is acquired
		6. verbalize the meaning to my kids
	* small, concise chunks of meaningful data at a time
	* perfect for visualizating words as phrases and transforming those phrases into thoughts / meanings / ideas / images
	* there's literally a picture of the text's meaning in the book ( visualization of the meaning is simply a glance away )
		* the glance location is irrelevant as meaning of the text and the picture of the text are the same
			* i.e. looking at text and visualizing its meaning is the same exact concept as looking at the picture and visualizing its meaning

## Practice: Focus on How You are Reading
* "Practices does not make perfect.  Only perfect practice makes perfect."
	* Vince Lombardi
* Practice creates habits ( both good and bad habits )
	* The *type* of practice matters more than the *amount* of practice
	* Example good / bad practice for "learning how to type"
		* bad: hunt + peck faster with two-finger strategy looking at the keyboard
		* good: proper hand position and memorization of key locations
* 3 stages to **acquire** a **new skill**
	1. **cognitive stage:** focused thought required to perform a task
	2. **associative stage:** improve accuracy + efficiency, much less concentration required to perform a task
	3. **autonomous stage:** perform task automatically with barely any concious effort at all
* Secrets to reaching higher levels of any skill
	* concious control while practicing and staying out of autopilot mode
Comprehension and speed improve by staying conciously mindful of the concepts / ideas being expressed while reading.
Similiarly, reading skill improves by staying conciously mindful about *how* you are reading.
* Force your brain to adapt
	* the brain restructures itself to meet cognitive demands
	* training your brain to handle data more quickly improves your brain's ability to assimilate information
* Memory storage
	* repetition creates long lasting enhancements to signal transmission capabilities between neurons
	* the more you practice a skill, the stronger your memory of that skill becomes

## Speed Reading is Speed Comprehending
* acquire clearer / faster comprehension
	* conceptualize phrases of words by imagining what the group of words mean
		* transfer data to the right side of your brain for parallel processing
		* imagine whole, complex ideas at once, as a single cohensive thought
	* distinct pieces of information are whole units of meaning ( ideas which can be visualized / conceptualized )
		* actively seek conceptual units of information
			* *not* smooth, consistent flows of evenly distributed data
			* more like clumps of ideas, look for the clumps, that will help you see them
		* proactive searching frame of mind causes clumps to automatically appear for you

## Why Learn to Speed Read?
* we live in the internet age where we are surrounded by information as text available on-demand
	* new era of do-it-yourself education
	* infinite amount of reading material
	* reading speed is the limiting factor to acquiring knowledge
	* superior reading skills provide greater access to information
* phyically enhanced brain
	* boost memory, focus, concentration, and analytical thinking
	* increased awareness of life by having a deeper reality of what things actually mean
	* your mind is what you "feed" it ( similiar concept: "you are what you eat" )
* cost-benefit analysis
	* cost
		* time investment
		* it's free, time is continually refunded by reading faster
	* benefit
		* enjoyful to read, comprehend, and organize data into useful knowledge to be better informed
		* the more you know, the easier to becomes to know more by correlating new data with known data
		* increased comprehension and retention of data is necessary in today's fast changing technical world

## 3 Mind Tricks
**1. Read meaningful group of words at a time**
* *etymological examples of coalesced words as hollistic ideas:*
	* 1940: *percent*
		* *per* meaning *for-each*
		* *cent* meaning *one-hundreth*
	* 1890: *forever* meaning *for-a-while*
	* 1925: *nearby* meaning *near-by-house*
	* 1960: *worthwhile* meaning *worth-your-time*

The point is, it has always been possible to read words together as long as the word-groups formed meaningful ideas;
reading phrases is just a further extension of this process of thinking and communicating in larger, more complex
conceptual ideas.

**2. Concentrate on Whole Ideas instead of Words**
* It's *not* possible to pronounce two words simultaneously, one atop the other.  Even if you could the result
would be an unintelligable cacophony of meaningless data.
* Likewise, it's *not* possible to think of separate words simultaneously.
* It is possible to think of the complete idea as a single thought represented by a group of words
	* Words have definitions, but real meaning is determined by the way multiple words are combined together
	* Word-groups are easier to visualize and understand compared to piecemeal standalone words themselves

**3. Conceptualize the Meaning of these Ideas**
* Actively think about what you read
	* causes the right brain to "see" the idea
	* avoid "blanking out" which occurs when looking at words without understanding their meaning
	* experience the idea VS looking at words and listening to words

## Final Thoughts
### Uniqueness
Your personal meaning of data is created by the selection and significance of attributes you connect to the information
through your previous knowledge, experience, and interests.

I started speed reading before I knew I as capable of speed reading, simplying by trying to speed read.  Before I tried, I always figured that I was just a slow reader, and that was the way things were.  However, after I took a course "Learning How to Learn", I understood my brain is a dyamically changing organ with significant un-used capacity and unknown capabilities.  I figured, what the hell, might as well try, after all, lady luck favors those who try.  So I tried and I am successfully in the process of acquiring speed reading as a strength in my skillset.

### Syntax VS Semantics
I personally learn best by performing recall and thought experiments while reading books.  Speed reading has helped me to acquire data efficiently and effectively by focusing on the meaning of the content rather than the content itself.

I'd like to share 3 examples of what it means for me to focus on the meaning of content rather than the content itself.
The first examples are recursive algorithms written in C++ code.  The final example is a physical example of a Rubik's cube.

#### Example 1:
**[Problem Statement](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-node-and-ancestor)**

Given the ```root``` of a binary tree, find the maximum value ```V``` for which there exists **different** nodes ```A``` and ```B``` where ```V = |A.val - B.val|``` and ```A``` is an ancestor of ```B```.

(A node ```A``` is an ancestor of ```B``` if either: any child of ```A``` is equal to ```B```, or any child of ```A``` is an ancestor of ```B```.)

![](binary_tree.png)

**[Recursive Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-node-and-ancestor/discuss/292557/modern-C%2B%2B-solution)**
```cpp
	class Solution {
	public:
	    int maxAncestorDiff( TreeNode* root, int ans=0 ){
	        go( root, ans );
	        return ans;
	    }
	private:
	    using MinMax = pair< int,int >;
	    MinMax go( TreeNode* root, int& ans ){
	        MinMax same{ root->val, root->val };
	        if( ! root->left && ! root->right )
	            return same;
	        auto[ minL, maxL ] = root->left?  go( root->left, ans )  : same;
	        auto[ minR, maxR ] = root->right? go( root->right, ans ) : same;
	        ans = max({ ans,
	                    abs( root->val - minL ),
	                    abs( root->val - minR ),
	                    abs( root->val - maxL ),
	                    abs( root->val - maxR ),
	        });
	        return{ min({ minL, minR, root->val }), max({ maxL, maxR, root->val }) };
	    }
	};
```

When I look at this C++ code, I see a post-order binary tree traversal.  At each level of the recurrence, the minimum and maximum
values of ancestor nodes are propogated back up the recursive stack and the answer is the maximum of all possible answers
deductively found per the problem statement's overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

#### Example 2:
**[Problem Statement](https://leetcode.com/problems/divisor-game/)**

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number ```N``` on the chalkboard.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:

* Choosing any ```x``` with ```0 < x < N``` and ```N % x == 0```.
* Replacing the number ```N``` on the chalkboard with ```N - x```.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return ```True``` if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.

**[Recursive Solutions](https://leetcode.com/problems/divisor-game/discuss/292472/C%2B%2B-solutions%3A-Top-Down-and-Bottom-Up)**
```cpp
	namespace TopDown {
	    class Solution {
	    public:
	        bool divisorGame( int N ){
	            return go( N );
	        }
	    private:
	        using Memo = unordered_map< int, bool >;
	        bool go( int N, Memo&& memo={}, int turn=0 ){
	            if( memo.find( N ) != memo.end() )
	                return memo[ N ];
	            if( N == 1 )
	                return memo[ N ] = turn == 1; // alice wins if there are no moves left and it is bob's turn
	            for( int i=1; i <= N/2; ++i )
	                if( N % i == 0 && go( N-i, move( memo ), turn^1 ) )
	                    return memo[ N ] = true;
	            return memo[ N ] = false;
	        }
	    };
	}
	namespace BottomUp {
	    class Solution {
	    public:
	        using Collection = bitset< 1001 >;
	        bool divisorGame( int N, Collection dp={} ){
	            dp[ 0 ] = true;
	            for( auto i{ 1 }; i <= N; ++i )
	                for( auto j{ 1 }; j <= i/2; ++j )
	                    if( i % j == 0 && ! dp[ i-j ] ){
	                        dp[ i ] = true;
	                        break;
	                    }
	            return dp[ N ];
	        }
	    };
	}
```

When I look at this C++ code, I once again see the recurrence formula based on the problem statement.  The top-down solution
uses recursion with memoization to solve each overlapping subproblem exactly once.  The top-down solution is acquired
after the base cases are reached and the answer is propogated back up the recursive stack.  The bottom-up solution uses the same
recurrence formula but in reverse by starting at the base case and building upon the recurrence of overlapping subproblems
until the final solution is reached.

### Example 3:

![](rubiks_cube.png)

I learned to solve a Rubik's cube by memorizing the "beginners method", which is basically an algorithmic sequence
of deterministic twists-and-turns combined with idempotent loop-invariants used to formulate a bottom-up solution.

#### Algorithms and Speed Reading
In summary, thinking algorithmically requires a similar mental leap of faith necessary for speed reading.  And the first step
at acquiring these skillsets is to simply try.  Try to "see" meaning with the mind's eye.  This was *not* a fast, immediate
process.  Instead I slowly acquired this skillset, a little bit at a time each day.  I slowly reduced the amount of time necessary
to understand the idea / concept behind the code, from weeks to days to hours to minutes to seconds.  Now I can observe these
"oh yeah, duh!" moments in my mind's eye more efficiently and effectively.

The idea of focusing knowledge transfer on understanding ideas, is simple, but *not* easy.  Like all things in life,
it takes time and practice.  Simply practice to learn a little at a time each day.

## Objective Measurements
I started actively trying to speed read via rapid serial visual presentation ( RSVP ).  With the RSVP strategy,
I was able to read ~400 wpm.  Now I'm focusing on reading chunks of data at a time, and I've observed my reading speed
has decreased signficantly, however I believe my rate of reading will increase with practice conceptualizing ideas
in word phrases.
